One day when I was about to start my lunch I lifted the lid of
the dal on the table when I loked at the dal I was shocked.
I pinched my self several times, this was not a dream, it was 
really happening, the dal had eyes. At first I didn't beleive it
but when I overheard the potatoes conversation I had to beleive it,
the first potato told, "Oh no! I forgot to do something for dal's 
birthday. Did you make anything?" to the second potato, who 
replied, "Even I forgot. Will you help me prepare a present?"
the first potato nodded and followed the second potato.
