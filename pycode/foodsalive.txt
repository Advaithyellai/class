One day when I was about to start my lunch I lifted the lid of
the dal on the table when I loked at the dal I was shocked.
I pinched my self several times, this was not a dream, it was 
really happening, the dal had eyes. At first I didn't beleive it
but when I overheard the potatoes' conversation I had to beleive it,
the first potato said, "Oh no! I forgot to do something for dal's 
birthday. Did you make anything?" to the second potato, who 
replied, "Even I forgot. Will you help me make a present?"
the first potato nodded and followed the second potato.
Then I saw a beetroot carrying a cake and it came up to 
me and said "Thanks for letting me use your oven."
I did not know how to reply. For a second again I thought to 
myself, "What is happening?" and, "Why am I going crazy?"
instead I said, "Anytime". I just left and never again saw food
talking or walking. This could have been my sister's prank after all.
